                 ##Tuples
Tuple - It is a built-in data type that allows you to create immutable sequences of values .
        The values or items in a tuple can be of any type.

         ##Stacks

Stack - It is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements with main operations         
        such as :
        Push - which is used to add an elemnt to the collection.
        pop - Which is used to remove the most recent added element.

        ##Queues
        
Queues - It is a linear data structures that use FIFO principle of odering to store items.
         it is similar to stack but it uses the FIFO which is first in first out for example of a line of the customers where the first in the line is the first out after being served. 
         There are various implementation of queues for example list, collections of deque , queue.Queue. 
         deques are also called doubly ended queue which is ipmlimented using collections.
