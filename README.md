# DATA SCIENCE
This repository contains three files that are stacks, tuples, and 
             
                 
                 ##Tuples
It is a built-in data type that allows you to create immutable sequences of values.
        The values or items in a tuple can be of any type.

         ##Stacks

 It is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements with main operations         
        such as :
        Push - which is used to add an element to the collection.
        pop - This is used to remove the most recently added element.

        ##Queues
        
It is a linear data structure that uses the FIFO principle of ordering to store items.
it is similar to stack but it uses the FIFO which is first in first out for example is a line of customers where the first in the line is the first out after being served.  There are various implementations of queues for example lists, collections of deque, and queues. Queue. 
deques are also called doubly-ended queues which are implemented using collections.
